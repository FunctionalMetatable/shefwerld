    <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
    Last night, the mysterious vandal of Apple the Cat's house broke into it. Apple was using all of his security cameras to record grass growing in his front yard, so unfortunately we don't have any footage of the perpetrator, but at least we know they didn't break on the porch, I guess. The thief stole all of Apple's cinnamon. Detectives believe that they then used Apple's personal time machine to take themself back to the past to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">play the</span> sell it to people who want to do the cinnamon challenge.<br><br>

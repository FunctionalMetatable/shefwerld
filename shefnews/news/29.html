Thing 1 repellent has gone out of stock in many major sellers. The reason is because a person called 'Thy N. Guhwon' bought all the repellent to supposedly 'add to his repellent collection.' Researchers say that it will take about a week for the repellent to come back in stock.<br><br>

Recently, the once thought to be extinct Cheeseburger Spider has been found being secretly bred and served to bird customers at Trashdonalds. We managed to get an interview with a penguin we found at Trashdonalds.<br><br>
</p><div id="interv">
Interviewer: And your name is?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Penguin: Keynsun DDDO?<br></span>
Interviewer: And what have you come here to order?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Penguin: Oh no I'm just here to clean clocks.<br></span>
Interviewer: What do you mean?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Penguin: I'm a professional clock cleaner, I clean clocks for $19.99 plus $5 if you call now.<br></span>
Interviewer: I see, and have you ever eaten a Cheeseburger Spider before?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Penguin: As a definite monkey I'm not supposed to but yes.<br></span>
Interviewer: You're a monkey?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Monkey(?): That's what my washing mach- oh. Oh no.<br></span>
Interviewer: What?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The monkey(?) left at this point<br></span>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
Marre Rio, the man who has been said to blow up several pancake factories, has been on trial. He admitted he threw a jug of diet bathwater at each of them (Luckily, Shef Kerbi discontinued it, so he won’t get sued).<br><br>

He is now in prison for 10 years.<br><br>

Recently, Stoify has been found fighting Yoemotoro, who has been assaulting him by creating and throwing more Stoifys at him. We asked Stoify what he thinks of this. Stoify did not have a face to respond with and proceeded to bleep out of existance before Yoemotoro threw another Stoify.<br><br>

Dreamtronix, who recently released the SuperPhone 2, has just announced the Dreambook. It will have all the emojis the SuperPhone has, as well as many more exiting features.<br><br>

Many people are exited for the release of it.<br><br>

Since I, Carmes, is a huge fan of Dreemtronix, their products (and especially their emoji), they have allowed me to show to SKNN viewers screenshots of me installing a preview of the OS that will run on it, DreamOS.<br>

  <span id="newsarticle_title">GREAT GHOSTLY NEWS</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by CrazeePi's Disembodied Voice</span><br><br>
  Dreemtronix ghosts have been unable to stock the ghost electronics store as planned due to the owner "going on a journey for a ghost fone." Dreemtronix ghosts have tried sending a ghost letter to tell the ghost electronics store owner to come back, but have unable to get past the Riddle of the Great Mountain Snail™ from the Great Mountain Snail on the Great Mountain. Dreemtronix riddle experts have been deciphering it for days to no avail. If anyone at home can figure it out, please send us the answer.<br><br>
  </p><div id="interv">
  "Oh thank goodness someone's here to save me. I've been stuck here for 6 months thanks to that lousy Keyn DDDD.<br>
  ...What do you mean 'Riddle of the Great Mountain Snail™?'"</div><p class="centertext">

  <span id="newsarticle_title">TOAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON!!!</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by EZGuy</span><br><br>  
  Just a few hours ago, a toad escaped from prison after finding a spoon under his bed. Using the spoon, he escaped prison. "The spoon has magical powers, it could teleport you anywhere." one of the guards explained. "This toad had used it to escape from prison. One of our fellow guards accidentally left it in there. We will be firing him after I finish this interview." We asked the guard what crime the toad did to get himself in prison, what he said was shocking, so shocking that unfortunately we are not allowed to share. If you live near the Dreem Lend area, be aware of this criminal, for he may come into your home and take your Nintendo Switch.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br> 
  The grand opening of the cool sandwich building in the area of the intersection of Broadway and King Street in Burlington has been postponed once again due to a giant manta ray silhouette appearing in front of it and covering the area with electric toothpaste. Although the Dreem Lend government has been assigning all of their Pianta janitors to clean up the area, their efforts have so far proven futile, due to most of their budget already having been spent trying to rescue people from Ted's house. Unfortunately, FLUDD is dead, and for some reason you can't revive robots. We have obtained an image of the area:<br><br>

  YouTube has just unveiled their latest controversial update. That's right, YouTube has just removed the feature to view and upload videos. The team at YouTube claims that this feature will help create a more positive environment on the site. In response to this, Reddit and Imgur are planning to remove their posting features as well. Although general reception of this update has been mostly negative, YouTube stands by their choice, stating that their databases have already been thrown of the roof of their building.<br><br>

  In other news, a tech reviewer has just discovered that you can make your iPhone shinier by pouring water on it.<br><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_title">NEW DREEMTRONIX TECH OUT</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  Dreemtronix has released both the DreemBook and the SuperPhone 2 Ghost Edition (a ghost version of the SuperPhone 2 which is for ghosts and the successor to Ghost Fone 2). Both of them still support nearly every feature in the SuperPhone 2.<br><br>

  Both products have been enjoyed by critics.<br>

  Due to this, the original Ghost Fone has stopped manufacturing this bulletin, and Ghost Fone Toos will no longer be manufactured after the next bulletin.<br><br>

  Professor Linda Muncher of Dreem Lend University decided to recruit the ghost of Professor Gourd-Oh for her team's ongoing research of whether or not ghosts can feel pain. Professor Gourd-Oh politely declined the offer, but the team hired him anyway. We believe it's very kind of the team to allow Gourd-Oh to continue his research after his death. What do you know, he might even find out something new about himself!<br><br>

  Breumhatta has recently opened his new service "Insta-Clean (but not clocks)", where he walks into your house and it becomes clean (except the clocks). Some people are a little suspicious of this because that sounds like magic and some people don't like magic for whatever reason. Breumhatta denies any connection to the service being magic, saying that he's just figured out a way to make dust scared of him so it runs away, except for clock dust because clock dust is kind of annoying like that. He also denies being a witch, and says that whoever saw him with all those other witches probably just misremembered. He hasn't commented on the pictures of him with all the other witches that we have.<br><br>

  Recently, Nintendo has unveiled their latest console, the Nintendo NX featuring an oval shaped controller. "It's hard to stop leaks," says a Nintendo representative, "Which is why we created an entire false Nintendo console called the 'Switch' with fake games and pretended it was the Nintendo NX in order to fool people." The new Nintendo NX is said to include games such as "Wario's Illegal Gambling Ring," "Kirby Surpasses The Speed Limit," and "The Legend Of Zelda: The Milk Of Spoiled." Every Switch in the world has responded to the jig being up by self destructing.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
  When YouTube was told to stop tracking people for ad revenue, they used an Uno reverse card, and the judge asked if that's actually a thing you can do. Then, they were sued by Mattel for using an Uno card in their defense. Here's an excerpt of the legal battle:
  </p><div id="interv">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube</span>: We have a green Uno reverse card, you can't beat us!<br>
  Mattel: *uses Skip*<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube</span>: What the-<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Judge</span>: ...I can't argue with that.<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Judge</span>: It's my turn now, but I don't have any cards. Does that mean I won?<br>
  Mattel: Yeah. That leaves us and them.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube</span>: That's not h-<br>
  Mattel: Ssh! It's not your turn! *uses another*<br>
  Mattel: As you can see, they have clearly used our intellectual property! *uses red Wild Draw Four*<br>
  Mattel: And they literally can't defend themselves! *uses Draw Two* Uno!<br>
  Mattel: *uses Skip* We win!<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube</span>: Alright, whatever, you win, just please let us leave.<br>
  Mattel: Not just yet! *plays Skunk*<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube</span>: Huh!?<br>
  Mattel: Haven't you ever heard of Uno Moo?</div><p class="centertext">

  <span id="newsarticle_title">SKELETONS ARE INVADING; MAN IS A COUCH</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Reali</span><br><br>
  Recently, several skeletons have been seen invading businesses in Dreem Lend, including SKNN. We are attempting to get rid of them, but we don't know how.
  Also, a man was recently turned into a couch in an incident that is definitely unrelated to the machine that turns people into furniture that we have on the third floor.<br><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_title">PAPER FINDS IT'S WAY HOME</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by EZ-Guy</span><br><br>

  That's right folks, our favorite piece of paper, papery the paper, has found its way home. He has been looking for centuries, looking for a way home, and after years of searching, he did. Although, when he found his way home, a paper shredder came along and shredded him to pieces. I'm not entirely sure I'm supposed to share this, heck, I was told that if I DID share this, they would shred me up too. But I don't care, shred me all you want, I probably just earned some money adding that extra information. I say when paper shredders threaten to shred you up, throw those paper shredders in THESE BAD BOYS:<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  Businessman Walfe Slem has recently purchased SKNN in a game of Monopoly on the Text Based GChat. This only happens in the Monopoly universe and not in Dreem Lend’s universe.<br><br>

  Several members of TBGchat have recently been promoted to admin after showing various pieces of information proving their adminship. The exact role of an admin is unclear for now, but it appears to give you a snazzy colour on the Discord chat. More on this topic coming never, because I'm not revisiting this.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_title">MYSTERIOUS FLOATING OBJECT DISCOVERED IN SKY (GONE SPOOKY)</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>

  Tonight, Dreem Lend residents were baffled by a strange phenomenon in the sky. Some kind of white cylindrical object was visible, facing down at the Earth.  The Dreem Lend Space Program has promised to check on one of their space cameras "when it happens to orbit a star for long enough for it fly back in our direction, or when aliens send it back on its way." Some witnesses believe that the object is made of cheese.<br><br>

  A few days ago, Apple the Cat was seen battling his evil twin, POLPCAT, on top of the SKNN headquarters. After heroically murdering POLPCAT by pushing him off of the edge, Apple had this to say about the battle: "how did i get up here help"<br><br>

  The Second TBGF Christmas Tree has just recently spawned into existence. Currently, Keynsun DDDO is carefully watching the tree's every move from a mile away. We recently got an interview with The First TBGF Christmas Tree for their thoughts on the matter:<br>
  </p><div id="interv">
  Interviewer: "So, what are your thoughts on The Second TBGF Christmas Tree?"

  <img src="media/uAa0X6M.png">: (says nothing because they're a tree)</div><p class="centertext">

  Unfortunately, we had to cut out the interview at this point because they were saying some very bad words and we can't have that on here without having a third party invading the studio.<br><br>

        "So my brother Random Person was arrested last week and I don't understand why. Apparently it was for 'unwillingly holding a person captive in our basement' but last time I checked our house doesn't even have a basement. What's up with that?"<br>

  <p class="centertext">
  I don't know. Could be a misunderstanding from the police. I know that the Dreem Lend police department have been trialing search warrants for potentially violent criminals using VR so they aren't at risk of injury/death. Google's 'house reconstruction' AI probably messed up and thought the house had a basement in it. Happens sometimes.<br><br>

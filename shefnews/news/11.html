<span style="font-weight: bold;">Breumhatta's Cleaning Advice</span><br><br>
Here's the tips that Breumhatta gave everyone:</p>
<div id="interv">
So if you really want to clean things properly, the first thing you're gonna need is a broom. If you don't have a broom, that's OK,
you can come get one down at Breumhatta's ACME Brooms And Co. Pty. Ltd.™. Anyway, once you have your broom, the first thing you gotta
know is that if something isn't getting clean, you're just not trying hard enough. Clean it more. Clean it harder. If it's still not
coming off maybe try a mop, which you can also purchase at Breumhatta's ACME Brooms And Co. Pty. Ltd. ™. Either that or it's a clock,
in which case I can't help you. If you've tried a mop and it's not a clock and it's STILL not coming off consider the fact that it's
probably supposed to be there. Well, that just about covers it, so hope this will help you all clean more efficiently, and if it doesn't
then you're doing it wrong, so you should try Breumhatta's ACME Brooms And Co. Pty. Ltd™'s cleaning for hire section, Breumhatta's Cleaning
Everything But Clocks Service.

  <span id="newsarticle_title">SHEF KERBI RUMOURS</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  There have been rumours that Shef Kerbi puts Anime Cosmetics' Toothpaste in his hair (if he has hair). People think that because Shef Kerbi is the main character in the anime 'Shef Kerbi: Right Back at U'. People also think that he cleans his teeth with the new Anime Cosmetics product, Shampoo.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_title">POPP STAH AND EARTH MIGHT BE IN PARALLEL UNIVERSES</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  Some scientists from Red Computer Labs came up with that Popp Stah and Earth are in parallel universes that residents of both seem to be aware of and access.<br><br>

  They say that because in SKNN reports, the Next Next Generation News Macheen (or whatever it is called)'s weather reports are reporting news from places known to be on Earth. They think that he can access Earth in order to do this. SKNN also once had a news report that a hurricane named 'DisneyLand' hit Canada (also on Earth) and sent it to the Earth’s moon.<br><br>

  Another reason we say that is because, Earth and Popp Stah are also quite similar in some things, including climate (although they are shaped differently).<br><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_title">APPLE'S TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN CORNER: Episode 8</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
  Apple has made a bold move in the design of the upcoming iPhone model (No, I haven't gotten tired of making fun of them yet). The screen does not take up the whole front of the phone. In place of a larger screen is a circular piece that sticks out, and can be pressed down with the use of a finger. Tech experts say that this design may not catch on. "I'm still going to buy it, though. I trust Tim Apple to make the right choice," says Apple enthusiast Manny Guye.<br><br>

It has been discovered that the use of the plaintext HTML tag in the latest TED Talk has transformed the building into an empty vacuum. Due to this, a few technical solutions have been proposed, such as using a vacuum cleaner to clean up the area.<br><br>

In other news, Intelligent Systems forgot which Fire Emblem game is next. Also, what is the new Windows Mojave? We don't know either, but that doesn't mean we won't make an entire article or ten of wildly inaccurate speculation for maximum profit.<br><br>

<span id="newsarticle_title">ACTIVISM NEWS</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
Some activists are starting to stand up for psychopaths all around the globe, stating that appropriation of psychopaths as heartless monsters is very inconsiderate of the feelings of psychopaths. Jim, a known psychopath, had this to say: 
<br></p><div id="interv">
"When I go home and turn on my TV, everything I see has a personal attack on me one way or another. I think that every single person who enjoys this content should feel bad right now. It fills me with depression and people really need to stop seeing me as the heartless monster I am- uh, aren't."</div><p class="centertext"> We also talked to a few activists about the matter, such as the turtle guy I use whenever I'm out of character ideas. 
<br></p><div id="interv">
"It's really saddening, you know? I used to see psychopaths as evil people just because that's what the media wanted me to think, but after I met Jim, I started to see psychopaths for who they really are, perfectly normal people. Wait a minute, why doesn't your comic series have more than one female character?"</div><p class="centertext">
  
<span id="newsarticle_title">HONEY FLOOD</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
Today, some bee hives in Hunneh Haav have leaked, creating a flood that covered 73% of it. Because it is on a hill, some of the honey leaked into Grean Geans, flooding 2 towns (luckily only 6% of it was flooded), but not the main town.

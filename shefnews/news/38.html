  <span id="newsarticle_title">PROTEST AGAINST THE LETTER ‘H’</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  For no reason, some random people protested outside the Dreem Lend Government Building, for the letter ‘H’ to be removed from the alphabet. Somehow, they fell into a room with lots of ‘H’s everywhere on the walls.

  Keyn DDDD decided that the letter ‘H’ will not be removed from the alphabet.

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
  When the Google Stadia entered the console market, no one was buying. The same thing goes for the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 though. Generally consoles aren't being purchased while they're releasing. The reason for this is unknown, though preorders might have something to say about it. I've also never seen a gender-neutral controller before. What the heck does that even mean? Is anyone buying the Stadia because it has gender-neutral controllers? Are they inevitably going to blame homophobia for the failure of their stupid always-online console? Why do they think players want always-online DRM!?
  <br><br>
  Oh yeah, I just remembered that they're Google.

  In other news, the Tesla Cybertruck. And is the Ouya coming back this Christmas season? It's just as likely to be the Gizmondo.

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by EZ-Guy</span><br><br>

  You, a millionaire, has recently decided that he/she (gender is unknown since he/she wears a mask all the time) will be bad now. You has already done bad things, like donating to a charity that supports people that hate news networks. We contacted You and You responded with:<br></p>
  <div id="interv">I thought being good was okay, but I started losing money so I decided that being bad would help me get in jail or somethin' and they could provide me with food and shelter.</div><p class="centertext">
  <br>Turns out, donating to a bad charity isn't enough to get You in jail. Now You is bad and is poor. You can send You some money at his Patreon account (we weren't able to find a link)<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_title">UPDATE:</span><br>
  You has just mismarked one of his/her videos on YouTube as "For Kids," when in the video, it included content that was not for kids. Despicable!<br><br>
    <span id="newsarticle_title">PIECE OF CHEESE MISSING</span><br>

  A piece of cheese has disappeared from Carmes' house. There are rumours that it went on vacation to the local supermarket.<br><br>
  
  <span id="newsarticle_title">THE SUN VANISHED!</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Keynsun DDDO</span><br><br>
  Recently, widespread confusion happened after there was no weather last issue, due to a lack of a sun and a moon to cause any weather. As it turns out, this was actually a demonstration of local business entrepreneur Keynsun DDDO's new service, Keynsun DDDO's Sun and Moon Removal Service, starting at $139.97 per sun removed and $179.96 per moon removed, with a special deal where you can get both removed for only $499.95. The service has not officially launched yet, but is already getting very positive reception
  <br><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">"Finally, people can stop calling me Sunburn Ern!"</span> says Dreemlend resident Sunburn Ern, one such lover of Keynsun DDDO's Sun and Moon Removal Service says.
  <br><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">"I've been looking for a way to skip past Mistah Shein and Mistah Bereht for years,"</span> Bob Speedrunners, world record holder in the OwnACopyOfKerbisAdventar% category, says, "But with this new service, I'll finally be able to skip them and hold all the world records for Kerbi's Adventar!"
  <br><br>
  So far, no negative drawbacks have been found from removing either of them, other than them being brought back out of nowhere so that they can give this bulletin weather.

  Turns out it was the moon. Have you ever tried closing one eye and looking at the moon, then closing the other? It sort of shifts a bit both times. Why are these two moons hidden in the moon, and what is the government hiding from us? Find out never lol<br><br>

  The grand opening of the epic sandwich building in the area of the intersection of Broadway and King Street in Burlington has been postponed due to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">nookyulihr waste</span> raining from the sky. On the other hand, the builders are very excited to get back to work to try their weird and cool new limbs. Construction will be resumed on ██/██/20██.<br><br>

        I hear that Keynsun DDDO removed the sun and moon from the sky. As he works here, can you tell him to put them back? I hear it's hard to buy a newspaper when you're frozen. So, you might be interested in bringing the sun back.<br><br>

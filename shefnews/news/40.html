  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
  In case you haven't noticed already, we've done a redesign of the SKNN website to keep the site more up to date with the modern web designs as entailed in Apple's Technology and Design Corner while still keeping the personality of SKNN. We have added a dark mode for the site, which you can turn on or off with the sun/moon icon, we've redesigned the comics, activities, news and home page and we are planning to create a whole new "Opionion" page.
  <br><br>
  Pages for comic artists Keynsun DDDO, Carmes and Bane Starbuckle have been updated to a format similar to that of Candy Sadness and Reali's (also new) comic page for a better comic viewing experience. Activites that rely on images get their own dedicated page and news reports <a href="40.html">#40</a>, <a href="39.html">#39</a> and <a href="32.html">#32</a> have also been given
  the new redesign with plans to eventually introduce this to all previous episodes.<br><br>

  The latest DLC fighter for Smesh the Ultimate, Blyeth, has the community quite angry. Half the community is angry because it's another Ice Crest character, while the other half is saying that he's actually got a very unique and interesting moveset. Here's an interview with people supporting each of these viewpoints:
  </p>
  <span id="linktosmash"></span>
    <div id="interv">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> Why do you think this character shouldn't have been in Smesh?<br>

      Salty Fan: We have 7 other Ice Crest characters, shouldn't some other series be given more representation?<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> And why do you think this character should be in Smesh?<br>
      
      Hype Fan: His moveset is really unique compared to most other characters, and it represents the character really well.<br>
      
      Salty Fan: He's still a swordfighter.<br>
      
      Hype Fan: He has a bunch of other weapons as well, and they're unique to his series.<br>
      
      Salty Fan: You could've done that with Steve.<br>
      
      Hype Fan: What?<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> What?<br>
      
      Salty Fan: Put Steve in Smesh already, you cowards.<br>
      
      Hype Fan: Excuse me?<br>
      
      Salty Fan: STEVE FOR SMESH WHEN<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> ...actually that'd be pretty cool<br>
      
      Hype Fan: That's a terrible idea.<br>
      
      Salty Fan: So was Blyeth!<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> Uh, weren't we trying to have an interview here?<br>
      
      Hype Fan: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!11<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> Wait why did you say "11" like that what<br>
      
      Salty Fan: NO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!1!!!!$!$@!@*&^(!$%!!^!%@*^!%@!<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> Uh, I think that's the end of this interview then.<br>
      
      Salty Fan and Hype Fan: NO, YOU'RE WRONG AND I'M RIGHT!!!!<br>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Zeke:</span> ...Well, uh, there you have it, I guess.<br>

  <span id="newsarticle_title">GREAT MOUNTAIN SNAIL DECLARES WAR ON IFVFFHREFERHF</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by CrazeePi's Disembodied Voice</span><br><br>
  Recently, the Great Mountain Snail, wise as he is, has migrated to Keyn DDDD's castle in order to declare war on Keyn DDDD's amazing assistant Ifvffhreferhf. "My name is Eskergom you loaded dummies!" The mighty Great Mountain Snail explains with dignity and pride, "First I get shop out of a shoptsos, and now I've been replaced?!" Personally, we find their reasoning of declaring war due to Ifvffhreferhf attempting to get a wildlife destroyer built on the great mountain thus destroying wildlife very noble, or as we put it in the Great Mountain Snail's own words on the dangers to wildlife that are caused by building wildlife destroyers, "Hey I thought I was supposed to get that wildlife destroyer built!"
  <br><br>
  We reached out to to Keyn DDDD, and he had this to say on the matter: "no im Keynsun DDDO," proving to us that he's the bad guy in a children's movie once again.
  <br><br>
  We will update this story as it continues to unfold.<span id="linktoIFVFFHREFERHF"></span>

  After the mass panic over the new Windows 10 security flaw which was estimated to have lead to approximately 10,000 @everyone pings across all of Discord, Microsoft decided to clear up any misconceptions about the announcement. Here's an excerpt from the QnA:
  </p><div id="interv">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> How much work will this take to fix?<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">A:</span> It's literally an automatic update you complete moron
    <br><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> I heard something about someone hacking all Chromium based browsers, such as Google Chrome and Edge!<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">A:</span> You should be using Firefox anyway <!-- HOLD UP Microsoft saying that you should be using Firefox and not Edge, their own browser? ok xd-->
    <br><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> How has social media responded to this mistake?<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">A:</span> The reaction is strongly negative

In other news, some nobody claiming they're going to "hack Discord" is totally a reason to ping everyone in every server you're in, and it's surprisingly easy to catfish people on Tinder with the name "Attractive Girl."

A strange person has recently been confirmed to dislike the "Pokeyman Dungeons of Oddity" series, which has been factually and objectively confirmed to be the best series in the world, totally. We are looking into this person's motivations, why he dislikes it, and why they're apparently not roguelikes. More to come never.

  The Dreem Lend Space Program has made an amazing discovery. Recently, an album by the name of "Apollo 18" has been observed orbiting Planet Popstah, and has reached the atmosphere and fallen to the ground earlier today. More news coming soon. Soon as in after you read this sentence. Turns out it was just from a test in which they threw the album into space in the hopes that it would reach aliens. Dr. Pherson Person had written "What?" on the case with black permanent marker for an unknown reason. Unfortunately, the album was lost in space. Dr. Pherson Person said "what" about its accidental misplacement. "How did we lose it in space? It wasn't even supposed to leave the planet."

A mysterious thief has been stealing headlines all over the planet as reporters wonder just where he will show up next. Here is an interview we performed with a customer at the Ghost Market who was one of the latest victims of the robber:

The Gingerbread Thief has since stolen the pretty cool sandwich building in the area of the intersection of Broadway and King Street in Burlington. The opening has been postponed until the builders can figure out that "over-exaggerate" is not a word. Police warn citizens to be on the lookout for animated gingerbread men.

The sandwich shop in Burlington that is always being destroyed every single day is going to have assistance from Carmes. Inc in construction. They will install a forcefield around it to prevent anything from destroying it in any way, by preventing them from even entering the construction site. People will still be allowed inside the forcefield.

<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Keynsun DDDO</span><br><br>

Recently, mass panic ensued after instead of celebrating the year 2020, everybody found out that they were actually celebrating 2021. Investigation found out that this was caused by local clock cleaner Keynsun DDDO, who accidentally cleaned somebody's paper year clock for 2020 so well that he wiped 2020 out of existence. "it happens more than you expect," Keynsun DDDO explains, "that's why there are only 2020 years right now." Keynsun DDDO quickly managed to replace 2020 after realizing his mistake with an entirely new year so that everyone may now wish each other a happy Keynsun DDDO's Clock Cleaning Service For Only $20.20 Minus 21 Cents Per Clock Cleaned Order Today, or "2020" for short as that's how much a clock cleaning costs.

<br>
the evil villain is boweser, which is bowser's cousin. trust me, my friend kyle says his uncle works at nintendo and that's how he got the game. I said "no you don't" but he said "no he does for real" and he has a foil charizard card so I don't think he's lying.
<br><br>

    Carmes has assured me multiple times that these cows literally have nothing to live for (apparently they're too poor to walk even though walking is free?) and that if those cows were to be freed, it'd only be worse on them.
    <br>However, seeing as they're animal activists, I don't think they'd care about that sort of explanation. An interview with one of these Cow-Fil-A cows would be helpful.

  As some of you readers may remember from back in issue #25, we compiled a list of the characters we wanted the most in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Many readers were pleased with these suggestions. Many readers were screaming at us, because hey, it's the Smash fanbase. But one response we did not expect was from Nintendo!<br>

  <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Another random character from Fire Emblem
</div><p class="centertext">
   Just last week, Byleth from Fire Emblem: Three Houses was announced as the final character in Volume 1 of the Fighters Pass! So this basically confirms that Nintendo is epically reading our suggestions, and will add new characters, "like Bulbasaur." We are expecting Dark Gary (from Nintendo Week) to be announced soon. If you have any good ideas for characters to add to SSBU, write in to our opinion column.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>

Carmes Inc built it at the request of Crazee Pi's Disembodies Voice, although cows who cannot afford anything, not even walking, cannot use it and have no choice but to donate themselves to Cow-Fil-A, a new burger resturaunt.

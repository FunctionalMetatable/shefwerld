  <span id="newsarticle_title">ANNOUNMENT - SHEF WERLD HACKED</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
  <span id="shefannounment"></span>
  On March 31st 2020, Shef Werld headquarters was broken into by a small group of people and what appears to be a cat(?). They proceeded to access Shef Werld's internal servers and release a bunch of internal information throughout the month of April. We do believe that they have only decided to release information that would be the most negatively impactful to our company however, which includes but is not limited to:
  </p><div id="list_items">
    - An early prototype copy of Kerbi Adventar that was then uploaded onto the CatsUnited Scratch account<sup><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/357240334/">[1]<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></sup><br> 
    - A promotional poster for a Shef Kerbi/Kawsaki tour due to happen on March 2019 that was cancelled<sup><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/3935875/">[2]<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></sup><br>
    - A screenshot of Carmes ads folder <sup><a href="https://ibb.co/k1qxJGN">[3]<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></sup>
  </div>
  <p class="centertext">Also, Shef Werld no longer has access to the CatsUnited Scratch account as it appears that the thieves also gained information that allowed them access to that account, with an apparent intention of doing that to "bring the CatsUnited account back to the right hands".

The water gun emoji has been deemed "too violent" for children. Alternatives such as rubber ball, poop thinking emoji, and salad without egg have all been considered. Additionally, they've just found out that you can use a knife to stab people. What this means for the knife emoji is unclear. Yes, the Unicode protests have ended. No, there was no resolution, the internet just found something else to complain about.

<!--ANIME KERBI-->
<span id="newsarticle_title">ANIME CHARACTER OUTFIT FOUND IN RANDOM PEOPLE'S WARDROBES</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
<span id="linktowardrobes"></span>
A weird anime character costume has been found in random wardrobes, including Shef Kerbi's. This is a mockup of Shef Kerbi's <span style="font-weight: bold;">hypothetical</span> wife wearing it:<br><br>
<img src="media/Kyary_Pamyu_Pamyu_Kirby.png" style="width: 10%;">
<br><br>
As you can see, it is very weird. There are rumours that Anime Cosmetics Inc's co-CEO, PreCure Selene (who if you don't know, was teleported from her own universe to Dreem Lend and later founded Anime Cosmetics Inc, now part of Carmes Inc) put them in the wardrobes, as several bottles of toothpaste were found in those same wardrobes.

We interviewed PreCure Selene over the outfits. This is what she replied:

<div id="interv">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PreCure Selene</span><br>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">はい、着るのはすごいです！それに歯磨き粉を入れるとさらに良くなります！わーい！</span><button onclick="translateText()" id="sheftranslator">JP detected - shef translate it!</button>
<br><span id="translatedtext" style="display: none;">
Yes, it's amazing to wear! Add toothpaste to it and it will be even better! Hooray!</span>
</div>
<p class="centertext">
Unfortunately, we dropped the piece of paper with the translation on right into Mount Ebott, so if you want to understand what PreCure Selene is saying, just use Google Translate.

<!--bon starbuckle???-->
<span id="newsarticle_title">IMPOSTOR BON STARBUCKLE SEEN ROAMING DREEM LEND</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
<span id="linktoimpostor"></span>
The imposter of Bon Starbuckle, now known informally as "Bon Tabuckle", is still on the loose. After the two murders, Tabuckle escaped the SKNN building and became a wanted criminal. Two days ago, the epic sandwich building in the area of the intersection of Broadway and King Street in Burlington was destroyed. Security camera footage shows that Tabuckle unscrewed a screw in the bottom floor of the building, causing it to go crash. Thankfully, most workers were already ghosts from the previous incident, and the two workers who were not ghosts were outside eating KFC during the event. There is currently a $5 bounty on Bon Tabuckle, but if you avoid catching them for a while, they might raise the payment

<!--CHUNK OF DREEM LEND-->
<span id="newsarticle_title">CHUNK OF DREEM LEND MISSING</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
A large chunk of Vegtables Hulk Valley has gone missing, all that is left is the default Pop Stah missing texture thing (not the one from Mehn Creft). 200 residents dissapeared as well.
<br><br>


Also, the studio that brought Batman vs Evil Kumquats is making another sequel! They need ideas of which evil people from Dreem Lend are to be shown to invade with the kumquats who come from the Fantamm Zoan. The movie is to include actors dressed up as them (the real ones are either destroyed or will destroy the movie).
<br><br>
Per the 2020 Guiness Book of Popp Stah Laws, Keyn DDDD cannot be an antagonist in the film, so do not suggest him.
<br><br>
This is the poster right now:
<br><br><img src="media/batman3unfinished.png" style="width: 50%;">
<br><br>Baika Kerbi and Thing 1 are already shown in the movie.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Despite these tough times, we've managed to figure out a way to continue the Opionion column. Shef Werld originally set up The Opionion Table at Kerbi City's Central Square, unfortunately due to Planet Popstah ending<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, we have instead decided to set up a call on Zoom to let people put their opionions in. Here is an example with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">minerman17</span> CallMeCarson:</span><br><br>

  I did see a petition someone set up to convince the devs to make an old school server where the world was at version 1.7 due to the overall high reception that iteration of the universe received. Apparently it has "dinosaurs", but I haven't checked myself.

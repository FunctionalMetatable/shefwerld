<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
After Bon Starbuckle's disappearence after the release of SKNN #25, authorities of Dreem Lend have been trying to locate Bon so he can get back to working on Ask Bon and Bon's Cat. Recently, some footage surfaced of a person who claims they know what Bon is doing after he disappeared from SKNN:</p><br><br>
<div id="interv">
<p class="centertext">
"...Bon is fishing<br>
For boots<br>
So far he's caught only fish"<br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="centertext">
We have determined the approximate location of Bon to be somewhere within the universe, however further evidence may allow us to find his exact location. More on the issue to come.<br><br>

    <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">by Carmes</span><br><br>
5 Cats, named Num, <span style="font-style: italic;">Num,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Num,</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Num</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Num</span>, have exploded in a pizza restaurant. They were last seen throwing olives at the cashier in that restaurant.
    
To get more info, we have interviewed the cashier.
<div id="interv">
Carmes: So, what happened?<br>
Cashier: They were throwing olives at me and angrily meowing.<br>
Carmes: Why?<br>
Cashier: No idea. I can retell what happened in this script-like thing:<br>
<div id="interv" style="width: 90%;">
It’s a normal day at the pizza restaurant. Random people are saying ‘Delicious!’ and other stuff.<br>
Suddenly, THE 5 CATS smash through the window, they start scratching the tables.<br>
PERSON: Ay!<br>
PERSON: Get your paws off my pizza!<br>
THE 5 CATS run to the till. They lick their lips, then scratch it, taking the money that fell on the floor.<br>
CASHIER comes in, angrily.<br>
CASHIER: Stop it! It’s against the law!<br>
THE 5 CATS are now angry, and they run to CASHIER.<br>
THE 5 CATS: MEOW! MEOW! MEOW! MEOW! (throws olives at cashier)<br>
CASHIER: That’s it! I’m bringing out my laser! (gets laser out and points at the cats)<br>
THE 5 CATS try to scratch it. Immediately, there is an explosion, and THE 5 CATS are obliterated.<br>
</div>
Carmes: Woah! That is a great amount of evidence!
</div>
<p class="centertext">There are rumours that the cats are bank robbers, or members of the Mafia.<br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">by Carmes</span><br><br>

Memers across Dreem Lend are going crazy that a Thanos Cat will be added to an upcoming game named Meankreeft Urrf.<br>

To celebrate this, TSM_Liquid_FaZe_Ninja has done a livestream of himself snapping his fingers for 5 hours non-stop.<br>

This is the new Thanos Cat:<br><br>

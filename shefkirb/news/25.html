<span style="font-style": italic;>A recent breakthrough in newspapers allows us to make newspaper that defy all laws of reality and animate themself. When asked how he managed to create such technology, Shef Kerbi responded<br><br>

Today, we are announcing the release of Collection 3 of Shef Kerbi's Apparel! We've kept the game controllers from Collection 2 and the Shef Kerbi hat from Collection 1, but the rest of the store is filled with new items, such as the Candy Sadness shirts and our brand new Animated Shirt, defying all laws of reality once again to craft a full motion animation on fabric (or the 3D printer material).<br>

Mysterious vandalism of Apple the Cat (the very handsome sknn employee)'s house has been happening for the past few days. Although there is not much information available on them, bear traps have not reduced the frequency or amount of vandalism, so the perpetrator is definitely not a bear. More on this story in the next bulletin.<br><br>

Apple the Cat has just discovered that you can purchase zero and negative amounts of items from Shef Kerbi's Apparel. According to one scientist, purchasing zero of an item will just get you an empty box that you have to pay shipping for, but researchers are currently waiting for the same second shipping to OH MY <span style="color: #FFFF00; font-weight: bold;">:smile:</span> IS THAT A BLACK HOLE<br><br>

Although Smash Bros. Ultimate's inclusion of every character ever in the Smash Bros. Franchise pleases most people, many fans are angry at the absence of iconic Nintendo characters. Employees of SKNN have compiled this list of the characters that fans are begging for most.
<div id="interv">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><p class="centertext">SMASH CHARACTERS WE WANT IN SMASH (whoops)</p></span>
-Cinnamon<br>
-Waluigi<br>

-Dark Gary<br>
-Rusty<br>
-Another random character from Fire Emblem<br>
-Trophies<br>
-Goku<br>
-Shef Kerbi<br>
-More clone characters<br>
-Bulbasaur with a Baseball Bat<br>
-Mizzo<br></p>
</div>
<p class="centertext">
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I am</span> The entire Flash department of SKNN (and not the Scratch one) is working on a game to include these characters, so ask Santa for that, I guess. It will be available on computers and the SouljaGame Handheld.

We're currently experimenting with putting animation onto cars, trees, fridge magnets etc.<br>
We're also trying to get full motion video to work (video and audio), however we're having an issue with not being able to do that on Text Based Gchat, yet we're able to do it on the website. However, we can test to see if the video rendering capabilities work live. Right now.</p><br><br>

Dear Bong Strad,<br>
Whenever I try to go out with my friends, I remember that I have no friends. How do I make friends?<br>
-Introverted Ivan<br>
Well, Ivan, there are many places that you could make friends at, such as an improv class down at a hypothetical community center.
Going is the easy part, but the hard part is not being an awkward weirdo. The trick to not being an awkward weirdo is 1. to not be awkward
and 2. to not be a weirdo. Hope this helps!<br>

So the weather thingo is still freaking out, might be that weird thing that broke our website but anyway, it's telling me it's a max of -19
and a min of 5<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">DIET BATHWATER SELLS OUT:</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by shef kerbi</span><br><br>
<a href="../../clothingstore/index.html">Shef Kerbi's Apparel</a> recently sold out the diet bathwater, due to it's insane popularity. Despite being limited to 2 per customer, people kept refreshing the page so that they could order more diet bathwater again. The Shef Kerbi Apparel team is currently trying to figure out ways to patch this exploit, so that we can keep a sustainable supply of diet bathwater. We interviewed Mr Diet Water himself about this issue:<br><br>
<img src="media/buydietwater.gif"><br>
We've had to close the purchase page for diet bathwater until our supplies are restocked.<br><br>
We do have a plan to keep diet bathwater on the market without selling out really quickly, however it's not ready yet, since this new system we're introducing could maybe potentially break the universe if it doesn't operate correctly. It's expected to be operational by the first of August.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">EPISODE 1:</span><br>
Many users of the popular social media site "Twitter" are concerned about the future of the site's design. However, this phenomenon of sites having terrible redesigns that attempt to reduce clutter but only make it worse is much more worrying than you may think. A 2019 study has shown that at this rate, by the year 2027, every page will be redesigned to the point where it is just a blank white page. A ton of CEOs from big internet companies showed up to some meeting so they could point fingers at each other and look important. Here is an excerpt of the meeting.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
Last night, the mysterious vandal of Apple the Cat's house broke into it. Apple was using all of his security cameras to record grass growing in his front yard, so unfortunately we don't have any footage of the perpetrator, but at least we know they didn't break on the porch, I guess. The thief stole all of Apple's cinnamon. Detectives believe that they then used Apple's personal time machine to take themself back to the past to play the sell it to people who want to do the cinnamon challenge.<br><br>

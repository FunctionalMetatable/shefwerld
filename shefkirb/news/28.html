Article 5: The fight over the vase ended with the vase breaking due to a fly. No-one won.<br>
Article 7: Recent footage shows that the Worp Star crash landed on seemingly nothing. Weird.<br>

Article 12.5: We have no info about who stole it, but we know why: To feed a monkey.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">Court footage courtesy of Dreem Lend Judicial Council - Ace Attorney for Nintendo DS™™™™™™™ and opposum box man</span><br><br>
On the 12th August 2019, the court case between opposum box man company inc pty ltd and "animals rights organisation" PETA was performed in front of a live audience. SKNN did not get direct access, however we were given information by the Judicial Council, and the opposum man has created a perfect recount of the events that happened during the court case. This is what we received:

  SCENE 1</span><br><br>
  
  <span style="font-style: italic;">The room of resolving pressed charges. It is furnished with things for resolving pressed charges. STAGEPLAY B. MAN is currently sitting in a chair. PETA PETE enters-</span><br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: (chuckling) Oh, Peta Pete?<br><br>
  
  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: (looks around) How do you know my name?<br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: It is in the script.<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: What do yo-<br><br>
  
  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: (looks around frantically) Who's laughing?<br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Oh, just thy audience.<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: I see your meat eating has caused you to lose brain cells, because I see no such audience.<br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Ah what it be, thou wanted something?<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: We're pressing charges against you.<br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Ah yes, for the dire deeds of sending deceased creatures, the creation of organ confetti, and the bees, I presume?<br><br>
  
  PETA PETE: Well there's a lot more than that, for instance we have evidence that one of your meat eaters demoli-<br><br>
  
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Speak nevermore, for I shall disprove all three of thy claims in a single swoop! Firstly, the deceased creatures! If thou look upon this evidence...</p>
  <div id="interv" style="width: 85%;">
    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Someone (opposum box decided to keep name of the person anonymous <span style="text-decoration: line-through; font-size: 10px;">even though you can search it up in the last news report)</span></span><br>
    "I sneaked into the opossum box factory and found 2 things:<br><br>

    malfunctioning machine that attempts to put opossum food into boxes, although some boxes were missed, some of the food was on the conveyor, and some boxes had around ten tons of it in. I think that's why there are dead opossums in the box. (btw all of the opossums were put into the box alive)"
  </div><br>
  <p class="centertext">PETA PETE: But you're clearly still killing innocent animals regardless!<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: But we shant confirm nor deny that we did purposely. Anyhow, next evidence!<br><br>
  <img src="media/9DNI8gH.png"><br><br>
  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: As thou can tell, Organ Confetti was not invented by the Dreemlend Branch, but merely taken from others!<br><br>

  PETA PETE: But-<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Silence, I say! Next evidence!<br><br>
  <img src="../comics/media/apple/14.png"><br><br>
  PETA PETE: But this is clearly just a comic about border control and not broder control, and why does his shirt say "SKNN?"<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Thou will find thy answers within thy box.<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN hands PETA PETE a box. PETA PETE opens the box to find this.<br><br>
  <img src="media/3Mp7srl.png" style="width: 85%;"><br><br>
  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>

  PETA PETE: What?<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Perhaps thou got the wrong box? Tryist another?<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN continues to hand PETA PETE box after box, with PETA PETE opening them as soon as he gets them in order to get this.<br><br>
  <img src="media/KkQQK5q.png" style="width: 95%;"><br><br>
  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>

  PETA PETE: (angrily) What is the meaning of this?<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: We only got one insult sorry.<br><br>

  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: So as thou can see, thou clearly hast no reason to press charges.<br><br>

  PETA PETE: But we have every reason to press charges! Your continued animal killing savagery and attempts to humiliate us show no bounds. As a matter of fact, we're pressing ten charges! That's how it works, right?<br><br>

  CRAZEEPI'S DISEMBODIED VOICE: (while having no idea how pressing charges work) Yes.<br><br>

  AUDIENCE: (laughs)<br><br>

  PETA PETE: WHO'S LAUGHING?<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN: Hold on, we have only one more evidence for thou that shalt blow thou away.<br><br>

  PETA PETE: And what's that?<br><br>

  STAGEPLAY B. MAN punches PETA PETE.<br><br>

An portal to an weird, inverted version of Dreem Lend has been found on a tiny island in the middle of the Orenj Ochan. In this world, Shef Kerbi is banned from the TBGs, SKNN's news reports are boring, and everyone has forgot how to laugh. This isn't the Dreem Lend we are in now, luckily (as this news report will never be released there).<br><br>

  As Shef Kerbi of the Shef Kerbi News Network, I am not responsible for the creation of the Wiki. However, one of my employees told me to put up an ad for it, so here you go.<br>
  As Shef Kerbi of the Shef Kerbi News Network, I am not sure of what content the wiki will contain - I imagine stuff like characters and products like pig soop or kerb pops.<br>
  By the way the Shef Kerbi News Network Wiki and Kerbipedia are two completely different things<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">HAMBURGER'S SECRET IDENTITY???</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">written by Zeke Teddy</span><br><br>
It's been recently confirmed that <span style="font-style: italic;">Hamburger Game</span>, the popular game on the Text Based gChat forums is exactly the same as the other popular game <span style="font-style: italic;">Word Association</span>, as two separate users have confused the two. In addition, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rock, Paper, Scissors...</span> has also been confused with <span style="font-style: italic;">Word Association</span> in the past. From this we can conclude that hamburgers and rocks are closely associated, in fact hamburgers are rocks and you should stop eating them because that's probably bad for your health.<br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">written by CrazeePi's Disembodied Voice</span><br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Recently, a wave of panic has swept across Dreemlend due to the site for Shef Kerbi News Network having a link on the home page that leads to a 404 page.<br><br>

"I thought I was going to activity," says one Dreemlender, "but it turns out I was going to activities oh nooo!"<br><br>

Shef Kerbi has been unable to comment on this due to being too busy eating Chef Boyardee.</span><br><br>

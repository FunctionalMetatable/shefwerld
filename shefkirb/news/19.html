<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE ON 2019 PARASITUS</span><br><br>
Professor Gourd-oh has made an amazing discovery as to the nature of 2019 parasitus. Since "-itis" means swelling, it probably shouldn't be called "2019
parasitus". Professor Gourd-oh asks of you to refer to it in all further instances as "2019 parenthesis". More news about 2019
parasitus coming soon!<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">BREAKING NEWS</span><br><br><br>
Some person has reported to the police that 3 strange individuals offering extremely unhelpful advice have shown up after she started playing a game of
solitaire. As of right now we are unsure of these people's identities or motivations, although they claim that they "were just trying to help, I mean
she kept missing all these obvious moves".<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BREAKING (and sad) NEWS</span><br><br>
Recently, while renovating the Shef Kerbi News Network Head Quarters, the server for the Shef Kerbi News Network website was destroyed. We are working on
recovering it, but it may take a long time, or even never happen.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Edit: We're back online and our website's better than ever</span><br>
In other news...<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">OPIONION<br><br>

So we told you Shef Kerbi News Network fans on our Scratch page that you could post anything with the #SKNN hashtag and you could end up in our paper!
Here were some responses given to Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Timman999999999 said:<br>
Honestly, I think the whole Stoify situation is overrated. He's got a worp star. Big deal, I got one in my backyard right now!<br><br>
imdatgameboi said:<br>
The new SKNN logo and format sucks and I want Mexican Ghost Dad to make a comeback<br><br>
JUSTye and TSM_Liquid_FaZe_Ninja said:<br>
JUSTye: Bon Starbuckle should do this opionion column. I think it fits him<br>
TSM_Liquid_FaZe_Ninja: Shef Kerbi should keep on doing it so that way he doesn't get lazy</span><br><br>

Recently, a new soccer team was made: SDreem KLand NSoccer NTeam. People were confused about the name, but the team told them that there was a perfectly valid
reason for it, before running away to practice. There are currently no upcoming games planned, but we will update you when there is one.<br>

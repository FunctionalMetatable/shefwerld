<br>
Shef Kerbi has been accused by Toadsworth on the 28th September of destroying Princess Peach's portrait at the front of her
castle and stealing $5000 a week before. We have gained special access to broadcast the court case live. Here's what happened:
</p>
<br>
<div id="interv"><p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Court is now in session. Toadsworth, provide us with your evidence<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> Our toads have done some research and have concluded that Shef Kerbi,
the person I have accused of the crime was the one who committed it.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Do you have any evidence to prove it?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> Yes, I have some fingerprints that when we put down onto our analyser
did not match with any of the toad's fingerprints. Also, Princess Peach knows her toads very well, and they would never do
something abhorrent like this.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> i dont know what ahornet mean?????<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Quiet, Shef Kerbi. Let's discuss this case to our jury. What do they think
of this case?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All Jury Members:</span> We all believe that Toadsworth is telling the truth.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> OBJECTION!!!<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some dude in the audience:</span> I don't think this is Phoenix Wright<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> What is it, Shef Kerbi?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> i dont hav fingre,,,, toadworth is lying!!!<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Well, that does contradict one of Toadsworth's Points...<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> i got antoher one!!<br>
<img src="media/evidence1.png" class="centerimg"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> toadworth ssaying i didnt steal 5000 dolar!!!!<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> That's clearly fake. You can see that me and a speech bubble are both in
cardboard, and you can clearly tell that I'm colored in.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> That's hard to tell. Still though, that is another contradicting statement.
Toadsworth, you are starting to lose ground<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> I can tell you something else. We have gained contact with the Toad
Express, the Mushroom Kingdom's national airline, and they have confirmed that Shef Kerbi did in fact take the
1645 flight on Toad Express Flight 34 from Dreem Lend to the Mushroom Kingdom on the 20th September. Here is
his plane ticket.<br>
<img src="media/ye.png" width="100%"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> that fake as well. you cant take a plane from one universe to another
unless sakurai announces its smashing time!!<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> No one else would've been able to do it then. We have narrowed it down
to you.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shef Kerbi:</span> what about mario tho???? he did this!!<br>
<img src="../comics/media/reali/2.png" class="centerimg"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toadsworth:</span> You can clearly tell that that was drawn in...<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Whoa! That is the best evidence we have so far, Shef Kerbi. Judges, what are
your opinions?<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">*Judges agree with Shef Kerbi*</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> Jury, what are your opinions?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jury members:</span> We were on Toadsworth's team before, but after that very high quality
evidence from Shef Kerbi,
I'd say that Shef Kerbi won this case<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge:</span> *formulating opinion* Okay, judging by the majority supporting Shef Kerbi, we
have decided that Shef Kerbi is NOT GUILTY</div></p>

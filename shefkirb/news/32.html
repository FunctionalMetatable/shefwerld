  <span id="newsarticle_title">ANNOUNMENT</span><br><br>
  So guys, we did it. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">We reached a quarter of a million subscribers...</span> It has been 1 whole year since Shef Kerbi News Network started up, back in September 22, 2018. Over the last year, Shef Kerbi, who had taken full control over the CatsUnited Scratch and TBGs accounts after they were abandoned in late 2016, has grown SKNN from a small startup news organisation to the biggest (and only) news network in Dreem Lend. Despite various difficulties, we've held on and managed to properly establish ourselves to Dreem Lend and the rest of Planett Popstah. <br><br>In comparison to other ventures from organisations associated with TBGchat, Shef Kerbi News Network has run for a long time with no possibility for a conclusion in sight (We've beaten <a href="http://tbgforums.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=3235">CoPKMN <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> in RP time!!).
  Another reason for the longevity of SKNN was it's integration into Shef Werld as one section of a site featuring a few other companies, and we thank Mr MemeoftheWeek and others who have helped establish Shef Werld as a major force in Dreem Lend for more than just news.<br><br>
  In celebration of the first anniversary of Shef Kerbi News Network, we have created an extra large news report, with some anniversary celebrations along with some never before seen comics.<br><br>

  Today, Ted gave a talk about how the HTML "plaintext" tag is the future of web design. The speech reportedly only lasted 5 minutes, because when Ted first said "plaintext", the entire building was rendered in plain text. The Dreem Lend government is trying to rescue people trapped inside of the building using scrolling "marquee" tags, but so far no progress has been made.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
  The host of the famous Dreem Lend game show "The Ultimately Unfair Game Show", Jeff Hostman, reportedly went insane today. His companion, <i class="far fa-smile"></i>, had this to say:<br><br></p>
  <div id="interv">"<i class="far fa-meh"></i>"</div><p class="centertext">
  
  Jeff Hostman, however, could not be found for comment, as not once in the entire game show did it actually show what he looks like. If you know what Jeff Hostman looks like, please send an image or description in the opinion column. One thing is for sure, his show will be missed. All of his possessions, including his toaster with gold bars in it, are now being auctioned off on eBay.<br><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_title">MAN GOES INSANE FROM VIDEO GAME</span><br>
  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Zeke Teddy</span><br><br>
  Let's Player Chooga A. Conroe has recently gone insane from playing version-exclusive content in a remake of the Superb Nontindo Enjoyment System game Mharle Trigger. He was last heard talking to himself, seemingly as different personalities, and complaining that "[he] can't eat your best wishes". Hopefully his mental state will go back to normal once he finishes the content.<br><br>

  Shef Werld Foods has just unveiled their new "Anniversary Edition" Kerb-Pops. These ones have the anniversary edition label because they've all been made to look as if they've been melting in some closet for a few months (which is close enough to a year). The ads also have a glacier in the background which makes them automatically cool.<br><br>

  Shef Kerbi Game Studios's most popular game, "Shef Kerbi in Apple Hour," has received a windows executable port, due to waning support for Adobe Flash by everyone. This version features redrawn clock graphics, altered Apple the Cat graphics, and a border! You can download it at <a href="../../game/src/kerbi.exe">Shef Kerbi Game Studios <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> right now! <br>Speedruns of this version will be on the same speedrun.com page due to there being absolutely zero gameplay differences at all.<br><br>

  <span style="font-style: italic">Hey Shef Kerbi I saw that the Shef Werld Scratch Page changed their profile picture to Snivy let's get literally everyone to point that out lol</span><br><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">So we told you Shef Kerbi News Network fans on our Scratch page that you could post anything with the <a>#SKNN</a> hashtag and you could end up in our paper! In this episode, we'll respond to some of your feedback with the new SKNN format, as well as show some of your cool stuff!</span><br><br>

  <p class="centertext">
    Well here's your exposure I guess. <br><br>If you're talking about radiation exposure on the other hand, that could potentially be a currency as the side effects of being near radiation could be translated into money, much like how some of those free premium currency things for mobile games let you get premium currency by watching ads or filling out surveys.<br>I'm not going to get into the ethics of this in case we get sued again.<br><br>
    One thing that seems to happen whenever we progress into a new Season of Shef Werld is that the profile picture to our Scratch page changes, and everyone comments about it on our page as a result. Here's just some of the comments we were sent in:<br><br></p>

            "So what you do is you get a screw, a knife, a Pig Soop can, a hot glue gun and two Kerbpop sticks. Get the knife and cut the Pig Soop into long, sharp segments. Hot glue the Pig Soop pieces onto the Kerbpop sticks, then get one end of both of the Kerbpop sticks and put the screw through it. Now try using it to cut paper. This is why Shefmart should sell products like stationery first before selling vaccum cleaners and $1000 phones."

  Sometimes, we create content that never makes it into SKNN. This can be due to various reasons, including but not limited to "quality control" and if the audience at the time would've been scared of it.<br>
  I think now is an appropriate time to show to the world some of the news and other stuff that never made it into the public beforehand.<br>
  DISCLAIMER: You may experience cringe/nostalgia if you are or were an SKNN employee. Also Fren Barrison never actually created any comics - he merely made an idea of it and made me (Shef Kerbi) to do the illustration.<br><br>

      Today's weather will be good. And a good cold front will bring moisture to southern Ohio. The last one was a snow shower. In the last three winters, we had three to four inches in the last few days of February. And we also had a snow storm of about 16 inches. So, it's quite possible that we will have the forecast in February to remind you."<br><br>

      In a related note, Gail said there is one area of the country where she sees snow coming that would be "a surprise" to Ohioans, namely the Rocky Mountains.<br><br>

      A lot of questions in my head and in the minds of Ohioans. I thought I'd find out the latest forecast from the NWS for February, and I'm here to say that it's pretty good for us.<br><br>

      Let me put it this way. As the NWS predicted, in the last few days we've had the best snow in the last couple of years. So, this should be good.<br><br>

      So here's a breakdown:

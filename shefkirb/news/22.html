<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">ANNOUNMENT:</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
Our management over at Shef Werld were getting worried that SKNN was becoming irrelevant (which seems to be happening), so to help spice things up, we've redone the website after winning the SKNN vs Github case. The site is now directly under the control of Shef Kerbi rather than Apple. We're also planning some fun corporate events to increase RP between news releases, and we've also increased the staff's pay by 15%.
<br><br>
Also, <span style="font-weight: bold;">MISITOUS BIRB DINERBLADE</span> has now left Dreem Lend with all of it's kids. We congratulate it in it's achievement, but we're glad now that it isn't generating hurricane force winds.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Today:</span> depending on whether or not you're around the city it'll
be raining, but whether the rain will be heavy or light is yet to be confirmed. It'll still be overcast whether or not you're
around the city, but whether the suburbs will get showers depends on whether or not the weather patterns go how we think they'll go.
<br>
<br>
Whether or not the temperature will be around the minimum of 13° or up at the maximum of 22° (C) will depend on the time of day.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tomorrow:</span> It's wet. Temperature is an output of [INVALID COLOR] f(x) = x + 15 where the domain
is [INVALID COLOR] 0 ≤ x ≤ 8<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU VIOLATED THE LAW!!!</span><br><br>
Although most people are happy with the laws as they are now, many politicians, such as Jordan Cabula and Reeling Tur'tll suggest that 2019 new laws should be added to the 2019 edition of the Guiness Book of Pop Stahh Laws. Examples of these laws are Car Jaywalking (inappropriately crossing the street via a vehicle) and Sandsocking (the wearing of socks and sandals at the same time in public).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NEW 2019 PARASITUS NEWS</span><br><br>
Professor Gourd-oh has discovered that 2019 parasitus is, in most cases, caused by inhaled clock dust fumes that play twister on your lungs, nose, and calendar, and can be prevented by calling a good clock cleaner, such as Keynsun DDDO, to clean your clocks for only $19.99 per clock, plus $1 if you call now!<br>

    "Hey guys The Great Cave Offensive: Battle Royale is in Season 26 now! What's your opionion on the update"</span>
</div>
I'd say Season 26 is a good update, although they did nerf the Wing copy ability, probably because it was exploited a lot by stream snipers (all of those reports about stream sniping came from you btw). The golden electric spear is probably gonan be really OP though because they buffed the damage from 116 per shot to 120. I imagine a lot of the strats used in the high kill games will use the electric spear. I also wish they'd fix the Sleep ability because that's been OP since Season 19, and it's getting a bit ridiculous. Overall though, it's a nice update, with the revisions to the map and balancing and everything<br><br>

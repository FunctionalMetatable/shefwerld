  The grand opening of the amazing sandwich building in the area of the intersection of Broadway and King Street in Burlington has been delayed due to unforeseen explosions, causing plenty of disappointment in the local sandwich enthusiast community. Sam Wich, a famous sandwich enthusiast and internet personality who runs a BlueTube channel known as "Sam "Sammy" Wich Whiches The Whichiest Sandwich in the Sand", talked about this in his latest video.

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
  On August 29th, 2019, Apple the Cat, a reporter and cartoonist for SKNN, was found screaming like a girl on a park bench with his shoelaces tied to the armrest. When asked why he didn't simply untie his shoes from the bench, he explained that he didn't know how to untie his shoes. He was able to recall the full story. One day earlier, he had fallen asleep on the bench. Some witnesses claim to have seen him looking at a pirate ship. Upon waking up, his shoelaces were tied to the bench. Whether or not this is work of the mysterious vandal of Apple's house is unknown, but this narrows the search down to people with arms, or people with very versatile limbs. Due to this absence, the Candy Sadness strip for the August 29th issue of SKNN was missing. Yes, he really makes those comics the day before the issues are released.

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Zeke Teddy</span><br><br>
  Someone reported seeing a strange community of various witch-looking people out in the middle of Nutteh Nün. It is yet to be seen whether or not they actually magic anything. Maybe they're the cause of the crazy weather stuff. Anyway, it's been reported that there were normal witches, flying witches, green witches, sand witches, lights witches, and Breumhatta. The presence of Breumhatta kinda makes me doubt that they were actually witches, but who knows, maybe Breumhatta uses magic in their cleaning service.<br>

      Recently, an people all over have died due to eating beans and rice. People were eating rice for three straight months and then they started dying. This is the most shocking thing I have read so far. So, my question is, if people are dying due to eating beans and rice, why not eat beans and rice? This is the only logical approach.<br>
      
      Please, spread this article all over the globe and let's talk about beans.<br><br>

      Vampires zombie werewolves have starting appearing in Europe this past week.<br>
      
      This is happening because the French government decided to start "drone assassinations" of vampires, a term that originated, according to Wikipedia, in the 1930s.<br>
      
      The term "drone assassinations" refers to shooting humans, which is a fairly new technique. The British government, which recently used a similar technique to assassinate a man who had called out for help on a live radio program, did not create the term.<br>
      
      In a society that doesn't have rules on the use of deadly force, government officials have decided to do things like kill vampires so as not to cause problems for them or cause too many deaths. They can then use their knowledge and skills developed off the TV screen to kill a couple hundred thousand people or even more in a few days. They will probably not take action, as it would "create an unrest among the vampire population, creating an uncontrollable population."<br><br>

      <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
      Scientists at Red Computer Labs has discovered traces of clock dust in beans used to make rice and beans. (Somehow there are a lot of clocks in bean factories).<br>
    
      They also found out that people eating rice and beans get nose and lung cancer from smelling it, and throat and stomach cancer from eating it.<br>
    
      They advise you to not eat rice and beans until the clocks in the bean factories are cleaned by Keynsun DDDO.<br><br>

  <span id="newsarticle_author">written by Carmes</span><br><br>
  Dreemtronix has bought the company that makes Ghost Fones, in response to what someone working at the Ghost Electronics Store said:</p>
  <div id="interv">Why do they only ship one Ghost Fone per electronics store?</div><p class="centertext">
  They will mass-produce Ghost Fones (using special ghost machines), so there will be many at the Ghost Electronics Store. Because they cannot access the Ghost Mart, they hired some ghosts to take the Fones to the Ghost Mart by Ghost Trucks.<br>
  They are also making an update to Ghost Phone Too’s OS to support all of the current Dreemtonix emojis and adds other apps in their phones.<br>
  Also, ghosts can interact with mortals. They can just about see ghost objects (but they go can go through them, just like ghosts and mortal objects).<br><br>

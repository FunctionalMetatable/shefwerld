Our viewers have noticed some inconsistencies between the TBG version of SKNN and the website version. In response to that, the TBG version of SKNN has switched back to the old logo for news reports, although our company's logo will still be the new one. We appreciate your feedback and would like to continue the OPIONION column. We will also credit people's work where possible.<br><br>
Also, ever since we first received reports about the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MISITOUS BIRB DINERBLADE</span>, we've set up a camera on top of SKNN headquarters and began livestreaming the event on our website and on Twitch. This will be the first time <span style="font-weight: bold;">MISITOUS BIRB DINERBLADE</span> has been on video.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">BREAKING NEWS</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Keysun DDDO</span><br><br>
Keyn DDDD, glorious keyn of whatever this place is called, has declared that he's "starvin' over here," and "that there Dinerblade is going to be my dinner!"<br><br>
He was later seen loading shoptsoses with local giant snail "Eskergom" and cannon balls.<br><br>
--<br><br>
Birb lovers begin a protest against Keyn DDDD for wanting to shoot Dinerblade out of the sky. Local authorities side with the birb lovers and tell Keyn DDDD to dismantle the shoptsoses. "Wait, shouldn't I be the local authority?" questions Keyn DDDD.<br><br>
In other news, local giant snail "Eskergom" is stranded on the Great Mountain. Please somebody bring him back, we miss him.<br><br>

<h1 class="centertext">OPIONION WITH SHEF KERBI AND BON STARBUCKLE</h1><br><br><p class="centertext">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So we told you Shef Kerbi News Network fans on our Scratch page that you could post anything with the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #6565ff;">#SKNN</span> hashtag and you could end up in our paper! In this episode, we'll respond to some of your feedback with the new SKNN format, as well as show some of your cool stuff!</span><br>
We began this issue's section with<br></p>

This was one of the response we got to the new logo, and we appreciate it! Our team raided Shef Kerbi's computer and found that he had a copy of Adobe Photoshop on there. Disgusting. <span style="font-style: italic;">(and I just wrote in the third person and wait what my photoshop got deleted)</span><br><br>

Here at SKNN, our philosophy is that if a customer is not satisfied with a product we advertise, we clearly haven't advertised it enough. Assuming she reads SKNN daily, here's an ad for VACYUM<br>

This next picture has come from an Anonymous person, as when the faxed the image to us they didn't link their Scratch account. Nevertheless, here's their picture:<br><br>

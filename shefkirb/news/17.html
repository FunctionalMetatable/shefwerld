It has recently been discovered that clock dust not only gives someone lung cancer when inhaled, it also gives people nose cancer, from a
tiny bit of the clock dust that stays in noses after going "boopity bop" or whatever. The clock dust there still play Twister, but still stay
in the nose.<br>
This is known as Mr. Somebody Sr, a citizen of Dreem Land, inhaled some clock dust (because he couldn't call Keynsun DDDO as he was missing).
Before his funeral, scientists examined his body and found lung and nose cancer stuff in them.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">End of Clock Eating</span><br>

The employees ate customers' clocks for $4.99 per clock.<br><br>

Wowie oaoowie! Apparently Keynsun DDDO, who can clean your clock for $19.99 plus $4.99 if you call now, has gone missing! Where could he possibly
be? Maybe he's cleaning a giant clock for $19.99 like the professional clock cleaner he is.<br><br>
I know how much Shef Kerbi News Network, the news network owned by Shef Kerbi which gives you quality news no matter where you are in dreemlend,
needs professional political cartoonists, like Keynsun DDDO, who is also a professional clock cleaner that can clean your clock for $19.99 plus
$4.99 if you call now, so I have drawn my own ghost comic using my number 3 ghost pencil, designed to be 50% better than number 2 ghost pencils
and are a steal at 0.99 ghost dollars.<br><br>

One of the ghosts I showed it to, John Ghost, who works at your local Ghost Walmart, giving you low prices on everyday ghost items everyday, said
it was so funny that it cured their ghost cancer.<br><br>
If this doesn't work, I found an old Adventures of Bird Guy comic, classic strips from the year M back in modern times, it's the Adventures of Bird
Guy you all know and love, premiering today in Shef Kerbi News Network, the news network owned by Shef Kerbi which gives you quality news no matter

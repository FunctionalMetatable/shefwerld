<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">from opposum box man</span><br><br>
<span style="color:#0000CC;">Hello, we here at the Dreemlend Branch have heard PETA's complaints and your desire to assist us, to which we thank you. We also thank PETA, and we will be thanking them by sending them a free batch of our newly developed Insult Boxes, each containing a random insult. We, unfortunately, ran out of insults so we are asking you for more. If you have any insults, please put them up on the Insult Board so we may package them together along with our own insults.</span>
<img src="media/sxeNzs6.png" style="width: 75%;"><br>
<span style="color: #0000CC;">Of course, there is still the matter of PETA pressing charges and making false claims. We are currently working on disproving these false claims, and you got to help us. If you need a reminder on what kinds of claims we need you to acquire evidence in order to disprove, check out the list below.</span><br></p>
<div id="interv">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span> We sent killed animals to people for profit.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.</span> We invented organ confetti.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3.</span> We shipped a swarm of bees internationally without prior knowledge from broder control.
</div>
<p class="centertext">
<span style="color: #0000CC;">If you do manage to find evidence disproving all three claims, we will make sure your efforts do not go unappreciated and we will send you a special reward.</span><br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by CrazeePi's Disembodied Voice</span><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Recently, large-time jerk "Knookles" managed to escape from prison and has begun a rampage across the entirety of popp stah. "How could this possibly happen?" asks one Dreemlender, "AM KNOOKLES, AWARHFAIJIDISJAFA," asks another. We managed to get a photo of the completely deranged jerk so you know who to run and scream from.</span><br><br>
<img src="media/sl4VnqI.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Currently, the plan is to create another worp star so we can send Knookles to the moon and let Canada deal with him.</span><br><br>

5 pancake factories around Dreem Lend have exploded.<br><br>

We think it is a guy called Marre Rio.

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Carmes</span><br><br>
A company that made teddy bears went bankrupt after being sued for putting lava inside their teddy bears.<br><br>

Nobody in the whole of Dreem Lend bought anything from them, though.<br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic">I have no idea where Bon Starbuckle went. I assumed he was on holiday with his cat but he may be held hostage by PETA I don't know.</span><br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So we told you Shef Kerbi News Network fans on our Scratch page that you could post anything with the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #6565ff;">#SKNN</span> hashtag and you could end up in our paper! In this episode, we'll respond to some of your feedback with the new SKNN format, as well as show some of your cool stuff!</span><br><br>

      "I sneaked into the opossum box factory and found 2 things:<br><br>

      A malfunctioning machine that attempts to put opossum food into boxes, although some boxes were missed, some of the food was on the conveyor, and some boxes had around ten tons of it in. I think that's why there are dead opossums in the box. (btw all of the opossums were put into the box alive)
      I saw a box being tipped into the conveyor, that had the Springer Logo on it, that contained what looks like the organ confetti."

  <p class="centertext">Not sure how you were able to post a new line character in our official SKNN Scratch Page‚Ñ¢, but ok.<br>
  Thanks for the evidence, it will be very helpful for the Opposum Box man in court<br><br>

So that's where all the diet bathwater went. That's cool, because <span style="font-weight: bold">we're discontinuing diet bathwater on the 11th August because it's not funny anymore,</span> although I bet all the diet bathwater fans will be creating a second hand market where you charge $2 million for one diet bathwater.<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you would like to submit your own opionion for Shef Kerbi or a question to Bon Starbuckle (or his cat), just go to our social media, on Twitter, Instagram or Scratch. <br>But prefably Scratch because that's what everyone uses</span><br><br>

Whespi Woulds has recently been interviewed as to what it's like being one of the easiest bosses in all of video games.
Here's the interview:</p>
<div id="interv">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "So, Whespi Woulds, what's your opinion on the fact that you're considered one of the easiest, if not the easiest, boss in games?"<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "Ah, very interesting. Why do you think people consider you the easiest?"<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "Wow, really? That's very interesting."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "So do you think they're justified? If they're not, who would you say is easier?"<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "Kreikeo, eh? Funny, a lot of people consider them fairly challenging."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "Oh, they're... just all scrubs? Eh, fair enough."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whespi:</span>  (says nothing because they're a tree)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interviewer:</span>  "Well, thanks for taking time out of your schedule for this interview."<br>

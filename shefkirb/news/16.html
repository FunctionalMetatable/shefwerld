<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ask Bon And Bon’s Cat Gornfeld #2</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Gornfeld,<br>
I was watching a bunch of videos of cats getting scared by cucumbers. Why are you guys so afraid of cucumbers?<br>
-Confused Christine<br></span>
Meow. Meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow. Meow meow.<br>
Translation: We’re not as scared of the cucumbers themselves, Christine, as much as what the cucumbers represent. You see, cucumbers are
used by dogs to represent all worldly evils that plague cats. Cucumber actually comes from the Dog Latin “that which greatly sorrows the feline”.<br>
Thanks for asking!<br>

On an unrelated note, a meteor has apparently collided with Popp Stah in a remote location. It reportedly looked rather small and yellow.

Earlier this week, Shef Kerbi has been accused of breaking Princess Peach's glass mosaic at the front of her castle, along with $5000.
This is not true and Shef Kerbi denies all of these claims. We have high quality evidence that has been checked by the Dreem Lend police
and they have stated that it's 100% legit

This challenger seems to think they can still win the cuteness contest. We have caught a picture of this strange challenger.
Don't mind the fact that it looks 8 bit, it was taken with a really bad camera.
<br><img src="media/yes.png"><br>
Related to that thing with kerbi and the other guy, turns out the cuteness contest itself ended up being a tie, but then they
got in a fight afterwards and kerbi won, so I guess that settles that.<br>
Apparently healers aren't very good at fighting. Who woulda thunk it.

fren barrison has gone on an unstoppable envy-fueled comics rampage. he blurts out this last comic before descending into an inescapable madness:<br><br>
straw!reali: i'm a silly comics boi hurr durr! i'm a stinky- Hey you know what? I'm tired of this strawman deal. I'm sick and tired of misrepresenting
Reali. They're actually good at comics, unlike fren. Fren just makes dumb text comics that he has Shef Kerbi draw. *pulls out a katana* I'm going after
fren, and stopping this. *runs off frame to get fren*<br><br>
fren:aaAAAaaAaaaah!!!! stOP COPYING MY JOB! IM THE COMIC MAN!!! I WRITE THE COMICS!!!! AAAAAAA *runs off frame to counter straw!reali*<br><br>

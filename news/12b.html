Pacman, a clock eater who eats clocks for just $4.99 per clock eaten but probably shouldn't eat clocks, has recently contracted lung cancer after
the consumption of clocks. Doctors say that this is due to the dust on the clocks they ate carrying Twister mats and playing Twister on his lungs.
"I told him man," says local clock cleaner Keynsun DDDO who cleans clocks for $19.99 per clock cleaned plus $5 if you call now, "I told him about
clocks." More on this and why you should avoid cleaning clocks later except it's not later because this is the only part to this story.
